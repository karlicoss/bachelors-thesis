* What is quasi-two-dimensional?
* What is "zero-dimensional system"?
* What is the purpose of magnetic field?
* What is the charge of the particle? e?
* What is "symmetric gauge"?
* What "tunneling between the dot and the channel" means? What is the channel in this context?
* Where does "V(r) = 1/2 m omega^2 r^2" comes from?
* What is U exactly? delta potential or what?

Bloch operator


u_l = I_l(r) - U_l O_l(r)

U_l = exp(2i delta_l): S-matrix



* Bloch surface operator? Non-self-adjoint Hamiltonian? Bloch-Schrodinger equation.
* u_0(0) = 0. Why? Because the particles should not collide?
